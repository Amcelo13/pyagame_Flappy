# pyagame_Flappy
                              **This is the application of pygame module**
                              
I made a flappy bird clone with pygame module.
This invloves screen blitting, changing FPS etc to blit the images at certain events in the game loop.

We can also modify specifically the collide method(function) to change the collision of the player with pipes, ground, upper wall etc. ==> Pretty cool Huh!
